# reinforcement-learning-snake
This is a simple implementation of the snake game using reinforcement learning. The snake is trained using the Q-learning algorithm. The snake learns to play the game by itself. The snake is rewarded when it eats the food and penalized when it hits the wall or itself.

The entire project is implemented in vanilla JavaScript. No libraries are used for the neural network or the game itself. The project is built from scratch.
